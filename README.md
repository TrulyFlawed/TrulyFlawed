## About Me

I'm TrulyFlawed, a transfem and beginner programmer from the United States. I'm hoping to learn more about the development and programming process so I can contribute to open source software. I believe in an free, open, and accessible internet that doesn't induce the necessity of relying on proprietary, monetized software just to do even the most basic things.

### Contact

If you notice that my code is slow, inaccessible, or otherwise suboptimal then I implore you to reach out to me to so that you may express your concerns. If you wish to reach out to me in regards to advice in code, documentation, or other means then feel free to contact me.

Contacting me may be done through the following methods:

- Messaging me on Matrix at `duskhasfallen:matrix.org`.
- Emailing me at `duskfall.personal@protonmail.com`.
- Messaging me on any of my socials. I apologize if I do not get back to you super quickly, but I will try my best.

That last is in order of my general preference, but try using email over socials if possible.

## Languages

Being relatively new to programming and web development, I don't have much to show yet. But here is a table of languages I have used, and my own level of confidence in regards to skill in that language:

| Icon | Language | Confidence in My Own Skills |
| ---- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| <img height="32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/192158954-f88b5814-d510-4564-b285-dff7d6400dad.png"> | HTML | My skills in this language are pretty good (it's hard to be "bad" at HTML, really). |
| <img height="32" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSS-Next/logo.css/48f24dccd4e169118d17bab998c3d276e95167df/css.svg"> | CSS | My skills in this language are intermediate at best. |
| <img height="32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/117447155-6a868a00-af3d-11eb-9cfe-245df15c9f3f.png"> | Javascript | My skills in this language are beginner, but not completely nonexistent. |
| <img height="32" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/183423507-c056a6f9-1ba8-4312-a350-19bcbc5a8697.png"> | Python | My skills here are very limited, as most of my attention is focused on the web. |
| <img height="32" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marwin1991/profile-technology-icons/refs/heads/main/icons/c.png"> | C | I am currently learning it. I have a lot more to learn still. |

I have a lot of work ahead of me if I want to actually get a career in software development.

## Current Projects/Side Quests:

My current main project is this [theme site](https://trulyflawed.github.io/Theme-Manager/) where I'm experimenting with the technical implementations of theming on websites.

The following are side quests that I intend to figure out later:

- Learning about managing GitHub repositories.
- Learning more about documenting code.
- Developing a Hearts of Iron IV mod. (Currently on hold for when I eventually get back into playing the game.)

## Open Source Projects I Find Interesting:

This list needs to be updated, but eventually I may have a separate repository for something like this to help declutter this profile README.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/) | A community-driven, online resource for internet privacy. |
| [Ente Auth](https://github.com/ente-io/ente) | A two-factor authentication (2FA) app. |
| [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden) | A password manager. |
| [TagStudio](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio) | A file management software focused on providing a robust and powerful tagging system. |
| [Revolt Chat](https://github.com/revoltchat) | A messaging app alternative to Discord, focusing on security, privacy, and openness. |
| [Commit Mono](https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono) | A monospace font. |
| [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) | A font (I think the font is cool, that's it really). |

Kudos to the folks at [Profile Technology Icons](https://github.com/marwin1991/profile-technology-icons) for providing programming language icons for use.

That's all I have to say for now, baiiiiiiiiii :3
