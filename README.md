## About Me
I'm TrulyFlawed, a transfem and beginner programmer from the United States who is relatively new to GitHub. I'm hoping to learn more about the development and programming process so I can contribute to open source software. I believe in an free, open, and accessible internet that doesn't induce the necessity of relying on proprietary, monetized software just to do even the most basic things.

If you notice that my code is not fast, inaccessible, or otherwise suboptimal then I implore you to reach out to me to so that you may express your concerns. If you wish to reach out to me in regards to advice in code, documentation, or other means then feel free to contact me. (I will add contact details eventually, for now, just attempt to contact me through GitHub.)

## Open Source Projects I Find Interesting:
- [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/) - A free, open source resource on how to become more private online.
- [Ente Auth](https://github.com/ente-io/ente) - A free, open source two-factor authentication (2FA) app that provides users with security and privacy for their accounts.
- [BitWarden](https://github.com/bitwarden) - A free, open source password storage and management software.
- [TagStudio](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio) - A free, open source file management software focused on providing a robust and powerful tagging system.
- [Revolt Chat](https://github.com/revoltchat) - A free, open source chat app alternative to Discord, focusing on security, privacy, and openness.
- [Shinigami Eyes](https://github.com/shinigami-eyes/shinigami-eyes) - An extension that highlights pro-trans and anti-trans users.
- [Commit Mono](https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono) - A free, open source monospace font (useful for programming, I like the font a lot).
- [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) - A free, open source font (I think the font is cool, that's it really).

## Languages I Am Currently Learning:
- HTML5 - My skills in this language are average.
- CSS3 - My skills in this language are average.
- Javascript - My skills in this language are practically nonexistent.

## Projects and Side Quests I Am Doing:
- Improving my frontend development skills.
- Finding more cool open source projects.
- Learning about managing GitHub repositories.
- Learning more about documenting code.
- Developing a Hearts of Iron IV mod. (Currently on hold while I wait for the next DLC to release.)

That's all I have to say for now, baiiiiiiiiii :3
