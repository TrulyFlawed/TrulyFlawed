# Hiya! I'm TrulyFlawed

I am a beginner programmer from the United States and relatively new to GitHub. I'm hoping to learn more about development and programming so I can contribute more to open source software. I believe in an open internet that doesn't need people to rely on proprietary, monetized software just to do basic things.

## Other Info About Me
### Here are some open source projects that I think are pretty interesting:
- [TagStudio](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio)
- [Ente Authenticator](https://github.com/ente-io/ente)
- [Revolt](https://github.com/revoltchat)
- [BitWarden](https://github.com/bitwarden)

### I am currently learning:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript

### I am currently working on:
- Developing some mods for Hearts of Iron IV
- Contributing the Hearts of Iron IV Wiki
- Improving my frontend development skills
- Finding more cool open source projects
- Learning about managing GitHub repositories

That's all I have to say for now, baiiiiiiiiii :3
