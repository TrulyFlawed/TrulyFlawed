## About Me

I'm TrulyFlawed, a transfem and beginner programmer from the United States. I'm hoping to learn more about the development and programming process so I can contribute to open source software. I believe in an free, open, and accessible internet that doesn't induce the necessity of relying on proprietary, monetized software just to do even the most basic things.

### Contact

If you notice that my code is not fast, inaccessible, or otherwise suboptimal then I implore you to reach out to me to so that you may express your concerns. If you wish to reach out to me in regards to advice in code, documentation, or other means then feel free to contact me.

Contacting me may be done through the following methods:

- Emailing me at `trulyflawed@gmail.com`. (Recommended as the first option.)
- Messaging me on Discord. (I will not make my username public for now; if I know you enough I am fine with you asking me for my username.)

I recommend email as the primary method of communication at first, as I will likely interpret "random" message/friend requests on Discord as potential spam or scams. Not that you have much choice, I haven't even shared the username (yet).

## Open Source Projects I Find Interesting:

This list needs to be updated, but eventually I may have a separate repository for something like this to help declutter this profile README.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/) | A free, open source resource on how to become more private online. |
| [Ente Auth](https://github.com/ente-io/ente) | A free, open source two-factor authentication (2FA) app that provides users with security and privacy for their accounts. |
| [Bitwarden](https://github.com/bitwarden) | A free, open source password storage and management software. |
| [TagStudio](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio) | A free, open source file management software focused on providing a robust and powerful tagging system. |
| [Revolt Chat](https://github.com/revoltchat) | A free, open source chat app alternative to Discord, focusing on security, privacy, and openness. |
| [Commit Mono](https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono) | A free, open source monospace font (useful for programming, I like the font a lot). |
| [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) | A free, open source font (I think the font is cool, that's it really). |

## Languages

Being relatively new to programming and web development, I don't have much to show yet. But here is a table of languages I have used, and my own level of confidence in regards to skill in that language:

| Language | Confidence in My Own Skills |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| HTML | My skills in this language are pretty good (it's hard to be "bad" at HTML, really). |
| CSS | My skills in this language are intermediate at best. |
| Javascript | My skills in this language are beginner, but not completely nonexistent. |
| Python | My skills here are very limited, as most of my attention is focused on the web. |

I have a lot of work ahead of me if I want to actually get a career in software development.

## Current Projects/Side Quests:

My current main project is this [theme site](https://trulyflawed.github.io/Theme-Switcher/) where I'm experimenting with the technical implementations of theming on websites.

The following are side quests that I intend to figure out later:

- Learning about managing GitHub repositories.
- Learning more about documenting code.
- Developing a Hearts of Iron IV mod. (Currently on hold while I wait for the next DLC to release.)

That's all I have to say for now, baiiiiiiiiii :3
